## PyEditor
PyEditor is a clone of CppEditor; as its name implies, it is written in Python. The purpose of PyEditor is to more easily allow the power of CppEditor to be used across multiple platforms. PyEditor was taken from the python branch (since deleted) of CppEditor. 


### Running PyEditor
PyEditor has only two requirements: python3 and PyQt5. The resources file for the icons is included, but in the event that it doesn't work, you will have to regenerate it. On Linux, run the 'main.py' script. On Windows, run the 'main.pyw' script. Both do the same thing; the difference is that on Windows, the 'pyw' extension tells python to run PyEditor as a Windows app.
